    "content": "To gain approval for use, biosimilar medicines have to be shown to be safe and as effective as the original reference medicine, and have the same quality. Based on this understanding, the committee noted it was appropriate when starting a new prescription of an insulin where a biosimilar is available, to use the one with the lowest cost. Additionally, people may be using an insulin for which a lower cost biosimilar is available. In such cases, the committee recommended discussing with people the possibility of switching to the biosimilar. This could happen at the person's routine review. They also agreed that switching to the biosimilar should be carefully planned, taking into consideration the dose-switching protocols, monitoring and the person's concerns about switching from their existing regimen, and a shared decision reached. Healthcare professionals should also refer to the summary of product characteristics for further information when considering switching to biosimilars. [Return to recommendations]([URL]\n\n### SGLT2 inhibitors for adults with type2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease\n\n[Recommendations 1. 8. 16 to 1. 8. ]([URL]\n\nStrong evidence from well-conducted randomised controlled trials showed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with type2 diabetes and CKD. Economic modelling for people with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) above 30mg/mol at baseline showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were likely to be both more effective and cost saving in this group compared with standard treatment. People with a baseline ACR of 3mg/mmol to 30mg/mmol will experience fewer cardiovascular events and events relating to CKD progression than people with a higher ACR. Because of this, SGLT2 inhibitors would prevent fewer events for this group in absolute terms, even if the relative effect was the same."

It is difficult to predict the extent of the impact because there is variability in how the 2011 recommendation with a threshold of 20% is being implemented in practice. However, it is believed, based on some recently published UK data, that potentially around 50% of people with stage1 hypertension and risk below 20% are already being treated with antihypertensive drugs ([Association of guideline and policy changes with incidence of lifestyle advice and treatment for uncomplicated mild hypertension in primary care. Sheppard et al. 2018]([URL]\n\nPeople with stage1 hypertension should already be monitored every year, but reducing the threshold will increase the number of people being prescribed antihypertensive drugs and increase staff time and consultations involved in starting and monitoring their drug treatment.

    "content": "They agreed that in practice prescribers would use their clinical judgement to choose an appropriate treatment from the remaining options, based on the individual clinical circumstances and needs of the person with type2 diabetes (see [recommendation1. 7. 1]([URL]\n\nThe committee noted some particularly important safety considerations to take into account before an adult with type2 diabetes starts on an SGLT2 inhibitor. The committee highlighted these because the SGLT2 inhibitors are comparatively new drugs and clinical experience with them is low in primary care, but the new recommendations are expected to greatly increase their use in this setting. In the committee's experience there have been multiple instances of avoidable diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resulting in hospital admission. The committee highlighted some factors that might put someone at higher risk of DKA, but the list is not intended to be exhaustive. Addressing modifiable risk factors before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor could reduce the risk of DKA and make the drug safer for the person with type2 diabetes. The committee were aware that adults with type2 diabetes who are overweight or obese may wish to try a ketogenic diet to reverse or reduce the severity of their diabetes or induce remission. However, the committee agreed, based on their experience, that there may be an increased risk of DKA associated with SGLT2 inhibitors and such diets. It is important to tell people about these risks and to advise them to discuss any planned change to a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet with their healthcare professional first. The committee did not recommend a GLP1 mimetic as first-line treatment for the following reasons:\n\n* GLP1 mimetics were not cost effective as a class at this (or any) stage of treatment for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with established cardiovascular disease."

The committee discussed the importance of patient choice and agreed that home monitoring should be an option, if it is suitable and the person is willing and motivated to use it. HBPM is already widely used in practice, especially for people with a white-coat effect. The committee agreed this would be reflected in the recommendation supported by the evidence and consensus opinion. Based on their experience, the committee agreed that training and advice would be needed for people using HBPM to ensure that people take measurements correctly and know when to contact their healthcare professional if they are not achieving their target blood pressure. The 2011 guideline included a recommendation for further research for the best method of monitoring hypertension in people with atrial fibrillation.

    "instruction": "What are the blood glucose lowering therapies that should be used when blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin combinations?",
    "content": "Given the progressive nature of the condition, in which intensification of blood glucose lowering drug therapies are indicated over time, there is little evidence, for some adults, to guide management strategies on treatment combinations that do not include metformin. Randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to better understand the treatment choices that are available which improve blood glucose control and longterm risks of complications associated with diabetes. When blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin combinations, which blood glucose lowering therapies should be used to control blood glucose levels? [2015, amended 2021] As the incidence of type2 diabetes increases in the younger population and as blood glucose control declines naturally over time, it is likely that further intensification of therapies would be needed. Currently, there is evidence up to second intensification of drug therapies, that is, when 2 or more noninsulinbased treatment combinations fail to adequately control blood glucose levels. Randomised controlled trials are needed to improve understanding of alternative treatment options for adults at second intensification whose blood glucose is inadequately controlled with insulin and/or triple noninsulinbased drug therapies. What is the optimal frequency for selfmonitoring of blood glucose in adults with type2 diabetes? [2015] There is limited evidence in relation to the longterm effects (at least 5years) of blood glucose lowering therapies, particularly newer agents in terms of efficacy and adverse events (for example, cardiovascular outcomes). Randomised controlled trials and prospective longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the longterm efficacy and safety issues surrounding these medicines."

    "instruction": "What blood pressure target was retained for adults under 80 years, according to the committee's agreement?",
    "content": "Overall, the committee agreed that the evidence was unclear and insufficient to determine whether a lower target would be beneficial and whether it would outweigh the associated harms. Therefore, the 2011 clinic blood pressure target of 140/90mmHg for adults under 80years was retained and applies to people with or without type2 diabetes. The corresponding HBPM and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) targets were also retained at 135/85mmHg. The recommendations emphasise the importance of achieving and maintaining a level consistently below the person's blood pressure target, whether this target be based on clinic blood pressure, HBPM or ABPM. Based on their experience, the committee members felt that people with postural hypotension are at risk of adverse events if a sitting or lying blood pressure is used for monitoring, because this measurement would overestimate daytime blood pressure and result in overtreatment. For example, a patient with a sitting systolic blood pressure of 140mmHg might have a much lower blood pressure when standing and be at an increased risk of falls if treated based on their sitting blood pressure. The committee decided to recommend that 3groups who are at risk of postural hypotension (people over 80years, with type2 diabetes and with symptoms of postural hypotension) should have their standing blood pressure measured, and their treatment modified accordingly if they have postural hypotension. The standing blood pressure should be used for future monitoring. The recommendations should reinforce current good practice. However, the new recommendations place more emphasis on maintaining blood pressure consistently below the blood pressure targets. As a result, this could lead to a higher use of antihypertensive drugs and an increase in consultations to maintain target blood pressure."
