    "instruction": "What are the main health risks associated with untreated type 1 diabetes over the long term?",
    "content": "# Context\n\nType1 diabetes affects over 370,000adults in the UK. It results from destruction of the cells that normally make insulin. Loss of insulin secretion results in high blood glucose and other metabolic and haematological abnormalities, which have both shortterm and longterm adverse effects on health. Over years, type1 diabetes causes tissue damage which, if not detected and managed early, can result in disability: blindness, kidney failure, periodontitis, and foot ulceration leading to amputation, as well as premature heart disease, stroke and death. The risk of all of these complications is greatly reduced by treatment that keeps circulating glucose levels to as near normal as possible, reducing tissue damage. Disability from complications that are not avoided can often be prevented by early detection and active management. Type1 diabetes is treated by insulin replacement and supported by active management of other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and high circulating lipids. Modern insulin replacement therapy aims to recreate normal fluctuations in circulating insulin concentrations. This supports a flexible lifestyle with minimal restrictions and, properly done, can improve blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of both structural complications and episodes of hypoglycaemia. Flexible insulin therapy usually involves selfinjecting multiple daily doses of insulin, with doses adjusted based on taken or planned exercise, intended food intake and other factors, including current blood glucose, which the insulin user needs to test on a regular basis. This selfmanagement needs the insulin user to have the skills and confidence to manage the regimen."

The committee amended the recommendation on automated dipstick tests from the 2010 guideline to emphasise that this should be used as a screening tool for proteinuria. The committee highlighted the importance of using automated dipstick analysis in secondary care rather than visual analysis, which they were aware from their experience has a higher error rate. Protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) were both shown to have high specificity and high sensitivity at the chosen thresholds (30mg/mmol and 8mg/mmol respectively), and therefore either could be used depending on local availability. The committee agreed that using both tests together did not have any additional diagnostic benefit. There was some evidence that using the first morning urine void in assessment of proteinuria can lead to lower diagnostic accuracy, and so the committee recommended against using this. As PCR and ACR show very high diagnostic accuracy, they should be used in place of 24hour urine collection, which is awkward for women and could delay identification of proteinuria. However, there are rare occasions when it might be more appropriate to use 24hour collection (for example, women with renal complications), and so the committee agreed it should not be ruled out entirely."

There is a strong argument for uptake of these new guidelines into clinical practice, in order to minimise unnecessary variance and provide optimal care for women and their babies.

The previous recommendations for people with type2 diabetes (in [NICE's guideline on type2 diabetes in adults]([URL] suggested starting antihypertensive drug treatment if lifestyle interventions alone did not reduce blood pressure to below 140/80mmHg or 130/80mmHg in the presence of kidney, cerebrovascular or eye disease. However, this was based on evidence from 2small studies in which the participants did not have hypertension. Further evidence for lower treatment thresholds in people with type2 diabetes was limited within this review, with the committee aware of some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure thresholds did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in people without additional risk factors. The committee therefore agreed that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a different threshold for starting treatment for this subgroup. There was no evidence identified on thresholds for people aged over80, and no prior recommendation for this age group with hypertension below stage2; therefore, the committee agreed that the threshold for starting treatment in people aged over80 should be consistent with the target for treatment in this population (150/90mmHg or lower). The committee discussed the additional risks of starting treatment in older people, particularly those who are frail or have multiple comorbidities.

Finally, the alternative treatment options for people with and without increased cardiovascular risk remained the same for later treatment stages. Therefore, the committee agreed to retain the existing 2015 recommendations for treatment options if further interventions are needed, without making any changes based on cardiovascular risk. To simplify treatment options, the committee merged recommendations for people in whom metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated into the existing 2015 recommendations where possible, and added the NICE technology appraisals as bullet points to the relevant existing recommendations. The evidence reviewed in this update was limited to the cardiovascular benefits of GLP1 mimetics and the committee agreed that this was only generalisable to people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As for first-line treatment, GLP-1 mimetics as a class were not cost-effective options for later stages of treatment, and there was too much uncertainty in the clinical and cost effectiveness to support recommending injectable semaglutide (see the rationale and impact section on first-line drug treatment). The committee did not look at clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence for the use of GLP1 mimetics to control blood glucose levels.

[2015] There is a lack of evidence on the effects of stopping and/or switching drug treatments to control blood glucose levels. The current practice of 'stopping rules' is typically motivated by either inadequate blood glucose control (rising HbA1c levels) or intolerable side effects. There is limited understanding of the short- and longterm effects of stopping a therapy and switching to another in terms of diabetes control (HbA1c levels), hypoglycaemic risk, weight gain, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is limited understanding of how quickly consideration should be given to stopping and switching to another drug treatment and, if stopping and switching may be needed, what the optimal sequencing is of drug treatments. Randomised controlled trials examining these different issues would help to improve diabetes care. In adults with type2 diabetes, what treatment combinations (for example, glucagonlike peptide1 [GLP1] mimetics and insulin combination therapy with meglitinides) are most effective when initial drug treatment with nonmetformin monotherapy fails to adequately control blood glucose levels? [2015] Although it is recognised that metformin therapy is suitable for most adults with type2 diabetes, its use is contraindicated or not tolerated in approximately 15% of individuals. To date, research evidence has largely focused on metforminbased treatment combinations."

    "content": "In particular, finding the right device for each person is likely to improve adherence, which means the device will provide more benefits and so will be more cost effective. The committee did not make a recommendation on using specific devices because CGM technologies are changing very quickly, and this recommendation would soon be out of date. Local healthcare services are better placed to assess which devices are evidence-based and suitable for use at any given time. There are benefits of providing a choice of different CGM devices because the most suitable device would vary for each person. The committee produced a list of factors to consider when choosing a CGM device with people. The committee agreed that this freedom of choice is beneficial, particularly because adherence to the technology is likely to be higher if the device is matched to the person's needs and preferences. The committee retained the 2015 recommendation on providing people with support from a healthcare specialist team with expertise in diabetes and the use of CGM. Community-based specialist teams are now available and are no longer always based in secondary care, so 'centre' was changed to 'team' to make this clearer. Despite the positive recommendations on CGM, the committee were concerned that existing health inequalities may still lead to lower uptake of CGM in some groups of people. To address this, the committee made a recommendation outlining actions for commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals. Given the rapid advances in technology, the committee made a [recommendation for research on using routinely collected real-world data to examine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of CGM]([URL] If routine healthcare data is collected, it can show the direct effect of implemented technology on the population, rather than it being interpreted through the results of clinical trials."

    "content": "However, this will also reduce the chance that a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is missed by raising awareness of the multi-system nature of the disease, and so could reduce the number of women who go on to develop complications from undiagnosed pre-eclampsia. Not all secondary care units currently use automated dipstick analysis to screen for proteinuria, so the recommendations might increase the need for automated reagent-strip reading devices. However, the accuracy and reliability of screening will be improved, reducing the need for further investigations for some women and correctly identifying more women who need further testing or investigations. Moving from 24hour urine collection to spot urine ACR or PCR will save time, with potential for faster diagnosis, and a reduction in inaccuracies because of incomplete samples. It is also likely to improve quality of life, as the process of completing a 24hour urine collection is time-consuming and awkward. A PCR of 30mg/mmol is already used routinely as a diagnostic threshold and therefore should not change practice. Currently units may use different ACR levels for diagnosis and so the recommendation to use 8mg/mmol will standardise practice. Recommendations have been made for the use of either ACR or PCR allowing local decisions to use whichever test is available, so this should not affect practice. Repeating the PCR or ACR test may incur a small additional cost. However, this should reduce the false positive rate, and mean some women will avoid unnecessary followup or intensive monitoring (such as hospital admission) if their proteinuria resolves and is shown to be transient.

Taking into account the evidence and the results of the model, the committee were confident that people under80 with stage1 hypertension and a cardiovascular risk above 10% should have a discussion with their healthcare professional about starting antihypertensive treatment, alongside lifestyle changes, and that this would be a clinically and cost-effective use of NHS resources. The committee also agreed that antihypertensive treatment should be considered for people under60 with a risk below 10%, with the degree of uncertainty in treating people at low risk reflected in the strength of the recommendation. The committee members were mindful of the additional population that would be affected by lowering the threshold and were aware that the decision to start drug treatment would depend on the person's preferences and their individual risk of cardiovascular disease. The recommendations highlight the importance of discussing the person's preferences for treatment and encouraging lifestyle changes. Some studies investigated the benefits of treating hypertension in people with lower cardiovascular risk or people with blood pressure below 140/90mmHg.

They also clarified that autoantibody testing is appropriate for people with suspected type1 diabetes. There was no high-quality evidence on tests to distinguish type1 from type2 or other types of diabetes, so the committee based the recommendations on the timings when the tests might be most useful (autoantibody testing is best used at the time of presentation, and Cpeptide is best used with increasing time from initial presentation) rather than which tests were most accurate. Based on clinical experience, the committee were confident that measuring autoantibodies in people with suspected type1 diabetes would be cost effective.

The only situation in which treatment would not be cost effective is if the analysis only considered up to the first 10years of periodontal treatment. However, the committee did not think this was realistic, as this excludes the benefits from reducing diabetic complications, which often happen later in life. For oral healthcare professionals, the long-term impact of the recommendations is uncertain. The recommendations specify that people should follow existing NICE guidelines on oral health. However, the recommendations may also increase awareness of periodontitis, leading to a possible short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews. Any increase in the number of oral health reviews will potentially impact on services, as NHS dental services already have capacity issues. A short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews will also lead to a short-term increase in costs."

    "content": "In the absence of compelling new evidence on step1 dual therapy, the committee agreed that the previous recommendations for step1 treatment should be retained (with minor changes for clarity), because they were based on robust clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence. One exception to this was the 2006 recommendation for considering beta-blockers in certain groups of younger people. The committee discussed this recommendation and agreed that beta-blockers are rarely used as step1 antihypertensive treatment in current practice and there is no established relationship between beta-blocker use in primary hypertension and a reduction in cardiovascular events. For these reasons, the committee decided that the recommendation should not be retained. The committee noted that this is consistent with most international guidelines. This guideline also updates and replaces the section on blood pressure management from [NICE's guideline on type2 diabetes in adults]([URL] That guideline recommended that adults with type2 diabetes of any age should start on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as step1 treatment (except women with a possibility of becoming pregnant and people of Black African or AfricanCaribbean family origin). The committee discussed the evidence for this and agreed that it was sufficient to support and retain this recommendation. The committee agreed it should be broadened to include the choice of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensinII receptor blocker (ARB; also referred to as Atype drugs), because they are now cost equivalent, and the committee also agreed they are clinically equivalent. For people of Black African or AfricanCaribbean family origin with type2 diabetes, the previous recommendation was to offer step1 dual therapy with an ACE inhibitor and either a diuretic (Dtype drug) or a calcium channel blocker (CCB; Ctype drug)."

    "instruction": "What factors should be considered when discussing switching to a biosimilar insulin?",
    "content": "To gain approval for use, biosimilar medicines have to be shown to be safe and as effective as the original reference medicine, and have the same quality. Based on this understanding, the committee noted it was appropriate when starting a new prescription of an insulin where a biosimilar is available, to use the one with the lowest cost. Additionally, people may be using an insulin for which a lower cost biosimilar is available. In such cases, the committee recommended discussing with people the possibility of switching to the biosimilar. This could happen at the person's routine review. They also agreed that switching to the biosimilar should be carefully planned, taking into consideration the dose-switching protocols, monitoring and the person's concerns about switching from their existing regimen, and a shared decision reached. Healthcare professionals should also refer to the summary of product characteristics for further information when considering switching to biosimilars. The committee retained the recommendation from the 2015 version of the guideline on considering the use of other basal insulin regimens not covered by other recommendations. Based on their clinical understanding, they added comorbidities (such as renal function), risks of hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis and concerns about adherence to the factors to take into account when considering alternative regimens. To support pharmacovigilance and patient safety, the committee also recommended that insulins should be prescribed by brand name. Use of long-acting insulins varies across the country, with some centres offering twice-daily insulin detemir to people who are newly diagnosed, whereas other centres start with once-daily regimens. A major shift in practice is unlikely but the recommendations do set out scenarios where other insulins such as ultra-long-acting insulins and biosimilars may be useful and cost effective."

They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the committee's discussion. ### Diagnosing hypertension\n\n[Recommendations 1. 2. 1 to 1. 2. 5 and 1. 2. 8]([URL]\n\nOverall, there was limited new evidence on the accuracy of different methods of measuring blood pressure. Most of the studies identified were small, and the populations and protocols for measurement varied making interpretation difficult. However, the committee agreed that it was important to focus on the evidence from these more recent studies (post2000) because the evidence should reflect the current use of electronic sphygmomanometers, which have replaced mercury-based sphygmomanometers. The evidence did not show that changing the current blood pressure thresholds for clinic measurement or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) would improve diagnostic accuracy compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), so the committee agreed the 2011 thresholds for diagnosis should be retained. The committee noted that these are in line with most international guidance. Limited evidence suggested that clinic blood pressure measurement is less accurate than HBPM or ABPM when used to diagnose hypertension. The committee members acknowledged that these findings were in line with their clinical experience and agreed that clinic blood pressure measurement alone would not be an adequate method to diagnose hypertension. The committee discussed repeat clinic blood pressure measurements when there is a difference in blood pressure between arms and noted that clinical practice varied. Based on their experience and knowledge, the committee members agreed that a cut-off of 15mmHg would be more suitable than 20mmHg, which was specified in the 2011 recommendations."

Labetalol is specifically licensed for use in pregnancy and so is suggested as the first-line option, with nifedipine as the next alternative, and methyldopa as the third option (as it may lead to more side effects and be the least effective option of the3). There was limited evidence on the benefits and harms of planned early birth compared with expectant management of pregnancy in women with pre-eclampsia, so the committee recommended that decisions about timing of birth should be based on whether the woman and baby are at risk of adverse outcomes if pregnancy is prolonged.

    "content": "Economic modelling showed that SGLT2 inhibitors were still likely to be both more effective and cost saving in people with a baseline ACR of between 3mg/mol and 30mg/mol compared with standard treatment. However, there was more uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness in this group than in people with a baseline ACR over 30mg/mmol. Because of this, SGLT2 inhibitors may not be suitable for everyone with a baseline ACR of between 3mg/mmol and 30mg/mmol, and the committee made a different recommendation for this group. There was no evidence specifically looking at the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors for people with a baseline ACR of less than 3mg/mol, so the committee made a [recommendation for research for this group]([URL]\n\nThe committee cautioned that SGLT2 inhibitors are not suitable for everyone and should only be used within their marketing authorisation. Some ethnic groups have a higher risk of micro- and macrovascular complications and so may benefit more from SGLT2 inhibitors. However, no evidence was found that stratified data by ethnicity. To address this gap, the committee made a [recommendation]([URL] for research. For an explanation of why the committee recommended angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, see the [section on pharmacotherapy in NICE's guideline on chronic kidney disease]([URL]\n\nThe recommendations will lead to a significant change in practice, since SGLT2 inhibitors will be prescribed more widely. This will result in a substantial cost impact. The committee noted, however, that there was likely to be a long-term cost saving from reduced downstream treatment costs, as SGLT2 inhibitors slow CKD progression and reduce the number of cardiovascular and end-stage renal events.

    "content": "This can help avoid assumptions about links between ethnicity and diabetes type (for example, assuming that people in Black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups are more likely to have type2 diabetes). The committee could not recommend routine non-fasting serum Cpeptide testing because of a lack of high-quality and clinical evidence, and this would be a significant and costly change in clinical practice. However, they thought it would be an appropriate test if clinical presentation and autoantibody testing did not provide a clear classification of diabetes (for example, if clinical features were consistent with type1 diabetes but autoantibody results were negative). The committee noted that serum Cpeptide is more appropriate in individual clinical diagnosis settings as it can be paired with blood glucose, while urine Cpeptide is mainly used in epidemiological studies. Because of the lack of high-quality evidence, the committee made a [recommendation for research to examine the effectiveness of C-peptide at correcting misclassification of diabetes at initial diagnosis]([URL] and the optimal timing for this test in distinguishing between subtypes of diabetes. It is likely that these recommendations will lead to increased autoantibody testing in people presenting with suspected type1 diabetes. This will increase testing costs, but this increase is not expected to be substantial, because of the low costs of the tests themselves. An increased use of serum Cpeptide testing in the classification of diabetes is less likely, because the guideline only recommends this be done if there is still diagnostic uncertainty after the use of autoantibody testing."

However, the committee noted that the study was based on people already receiving treatment and that it lacked information on adverse events. The committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that blood pressure targets should be different in people with type2 diabetes. Evidence for lower targets in people with type2 diabetes was also limited, with some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure targets did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events.

    "content": "There was good evidence that a PCR of 30mg/mmol had good diagnostic accuracy, showing high sensitivity and specificity and should be used as the threshold for significant proteinuria. However, the committee recommended retesting for results above 30mg/mmol if there is still diagnostic uncertainty (for example, the woman has no other clinical signs or symptoms of pre-eclampsia) because there is large variation in protein excretion during the day and from day to day. The committee agreed that this would prevent women being diagnosed with pre-eclampsia on the basis of a single raised PCR result. Evidence from a single study showed high sensitivity and specificity for an ACR result of 8mg/mmol to diagnose proteinuria. However, the committee were also aware of further results from a large, UKbased study, which provided further evidence for the efficacy of a threshold of 8mg/mmol in the diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia. The committee were aware that this threshold is different to that used for detection of microalbuminuria in the non-pregnant population. However, they agreed that, on the basis of the evidence reviewed, it was appropriate to use a threshold of 8mg/mmol for pregnant women. As with PCR, the committee were aware that women are sometimes diagnosed with pre-eclampsia on the basis of a single raised ACR, and that this may lead to over-diagnosis. Therefore, they made a recommendation to consider repeating the ACR measurement if there was ongoing clinical uncertainty about the diagnosis. No evidence was reviewed that examined the timing of repeat testing for either ACR or PCR, and so no recommendations could be made regarding this. The recommendation to take account of other clinical features when assessing women for suspected pre-eclampsia might lead to an increased need for followup and surveillance."

    "content": "There was no evidence that real-time CGM (rtCGM) was cost effective for people with type2 diabetes, so the committee agreed it could not be recommended for all adults with type2 diabetes (whether or not they used insulin). They noted, however, that prices of rtCGM have reduced over the past few years, and if this continues to happen there may come a time when it is no more expensive than isCGM. At this point, rtCGM would be an appropriate alternative for people who meet the criteria for isCGM. The committee did not make a recommendation on using specific devices because CGM technologies are changing very quickly and this recommendation would soon be out of date. Local healthcare services are better placed to assess which devices are evidence-based and suitable for use at any given time. The committee discussed how self-monitoring of blood glucose should still take place, albeit less frequently, even when a person is using CGM. The ability to self-monitor blood glucose levels allows people to ensure the accuracy of the CGM device. The committee also recommended keeping capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up for situations such as when the technology fails. The committee decided to highlight that CGM should be provided by a team who have expertise in its use. To ensure that CGM is effective, healthcare professionals need to have the skills to interpret and communicate the data effectively. As well as healthcare professionals having a clear understanding of CGM, it is also crucial that people with type2 diabetes who are using CGM have education about the technology. This will increase the likelihood that people will scan and report the results frequently, allowing people to understand and manage their diabetes effectively. Although many people will choose CGM if offered, there are some people who either cannot be offered it or do not want to use it."

    "content": "There were differences in clinical effectiveness between the injectable and oral forms of semaglutide compared with placebo for some outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, based on the evidence from the trials. However, the committee agreed it was uncertain whether the observed differences in effect were real or might be related to the relatively small size and low event rates in these trials compared with other trials included in the review, which resulted in wide 95% confidence intervals around the effect estimates for some outcomes. The committee concluded that the factors above combined to give such a high level of uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness of injectable semaglutide that they could not make a positive recommendation for its use. The recommendations to offer SGLT2 inhibitors with metformin to adults with type2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at first-line treatment (or if they are already taking metformin monotherapy) are expected to lead to a change in practice and increase the number of people taking SGLT2 inhibitors at the beginning of their treatment. This is also expected to be the case for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as this category is expected to cover a large proportion of adults with type2 diabetes. In current practice, these people would not be offered combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor until additional treatment is needed to control their HbA1c to below their individually agreed threshold for intervention, and then only if they met the criteria in the relevant NICE technology appraisals for being prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor.

    "content": "However, these recommendations were based on monotherapy studies and when the committee looked at this evidence alongside the new dual therapy evidence review, they concluded that it was insufficient to recommend starting dual therapy in any subgroup of people with type2 diabetes. The committee noted that people with type2 diabetes who are older or are of Black African or AfricanCaribbean family origin may not achieve their target blood pressure on ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy and may need to start step2 drug therapy in the short term. Overall, the recommendations for step1 treatment reflect current practice for people who do not have type2 diabetes. For people of Black African or AfricanCaribbean family origin who have type2 diabetes, the recommendation to start antihypertensive monotherapy rather than dual therapy may result in an extra clinical appointment if the dose needs to be adjusted. However, it may also reduce potential harms from initial overtreatment of blood pressure.

    "instruction": "What was the conclusion regarding the differentiation between SGLT2 inhibitors and placebo for non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke?",
    "content": "For non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke, the network meta-analysis could not differentiate between empagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin or placebo. The data for dapagliflozin was reported differently and could not be included in the network meta-analyses. In the clinical trial data, dapagliflozin could not be differentiated from placebo for myocardial infarction and was not meaningfully different from placebo for stroke. Finally, only dapagliflozin showed a clinically meaningful reduction in severe hypoglycaemia compared with placebo. However, the remaining SGLT2 inhibitors could not be differentiated from each other or from placebo in the network meta-analysis. Taking the cost effectiveness and clinical results into account, the committee decided against recommending only dapagliflozin and instead made recommendations for the SGLT2 inhibitors as a class. However, they recognised that there was greater uncertainty around the cardiovascular benefits associated with ertugliflozin than there was for empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. This was because ertugliflozin did not consistently show a reduction in heart failure compared with placebo in the network meta-analyses (it depended on the model used), and it was not statistically significantly better than placebo for the 3point MACE outcome. The committee therefore decided to refer to 'SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit' in the recommendations. This was to enable prescribers to select a particular drug from the class of SGLT2 inhibitors that they thought was clinically appropriate for each person, while allowing the recommendation to remain current even if additional evidence or new SGLT2 inhibitors become available."

[Return to recommendations]([URL]\n\n[Recommendations 1. 4. 15 to 1. 4. 22]([URL]\n\nNo evidence was identified to determine whether cardiovascular risk or blood pressure targets should be used. The committee agreed that in the absence of evidence the focus should be on blood pressure targets, based on their expertise and experience of current practice. The evidence for blood pressure targets showed that there were both benefits and harms associated with a lower clinic systolic blood pressure target of 120mmHg compared with 140mmHg in people with primary hypertension without type2 diabetes. Although the evidence suggested some benefit in reducing mortality and cardiovascular events, the lower blood pressure target was associated with a greater risk of harms, such as injury from falls and acute kidney injury. The committee agreed that the long-term implications of these adverse events were unclear and that further research is needed. This evidence came from the SPRINT trial, which was a large study undertaken in the US. The committee discussed concerns about the population included in the study and the applicability to UK practice of the methods used. The study used automated blood pressure devices with a time delay and an isolated rest period, which is not common practice in the UK. The committee considered that the use of these devices would lead to lower blood pressure readings than in routine UK clinical practice. They also had concerns that some medicines were stopped when blood pressure targets were achieved, which may have had an impact on the results."

    "instruction": "When might healthcare professionals recommend insulin glargine over insulin detemir?",
    "content": "Some people may not be able to tolerate insulin detemir, or for some, a once-daily regimen may be necessary (either because the person has a strong preference for once-daily injections or there are circumstances that make twice daily not practical). Glargine (100units/ml) was found to be the most cost-effective once-daily insulin (particularly when the costs of glargine biosimilars were considered) so it was recommended as the appropriate alternative in these cases. People on insulin therapies can still have hypoglycaemic episodes. This can be a cause of concern, particularly if they have nocturnal hypoglycaemic events. Evidence showed a lower proportion of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events with degludec (100units/ml), when compared with other once-daily insulins. Degludec (100units/ml) is an ultra-long-acting insulin, which means it has a longer duration of action compared with long-acting insulins. The committee agreed that once-daily degludec could therefore be considered as an alternative basal insulin therapy if there is a particular concern about nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The committee agreed that once-daily ultra-long-acting insulin regimens, such as insulin degludec (100units/ml), may also be needed by people who need support from a carer or healthcare professional to administer injections, for example, because they are frail or have a physical or mental health condition, or learning disability. Insulins that offer flexibility in dosing time, such as insulin degludec (100units/ml), have a long duration of action and may be particularly useful because they give more flexibility in when the dose can be given. Insulin glargine (300units/ml) is another example of an ultra-long-acting insulin. Healthcare professionals should also refer to [NHS England's patient safety alert on the risk of severe harm and death from inappropriately withdrawing insulin from pen devices]([URL]\n\nBiosimilars have the potential to offer the NHS considerable cost savings."

The committee agreed that this would include (but was not limited to) reasons such as severe hypertension or other features of pre-eclampsia indicating increased risk of adverse outcomes. There was some evidence that the fullPIERS and PREPS models can help identify women at different risks of adverse outcomes because of pre-eclampsia. There was more extensive validation of the fullPIERS model, and the validation studies were conducted in populations from a range of healthcare settings. The PREPS model had been developed using a UK population, and validated using data from similar multinational settings. It was noted that further validation of PREPS was unlikely to be conducted, because of the cost of conducting these studies. The committee therefore agreed that both models could be considered as options, in addition to a full clinical assessment, to help guide decisions relating to interventions and place of care."

    "instruction": "What does the NICE guideline highlight about the management and prevalence of hypertension in England?",
    "content": "# Context\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important, treatable causes of premature morbidity and mortality in the world. It is a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline and premature death. In 2015, it was reported that high blood pressure affected more than 1in 4adults in England (31% of men; 26% of women)  around 13. 5million people  and contributed to 75,000deaths. The clinical management of hypertension accounts for 12% of visits to primary care and up to 2. 1billion of healthcare expenditure. Managing the cardiovascular events caused by hypertension also consumes considerable resources. The guideline covers adults (over 18years) with suspected or diagnosed hypertension, including those with type2 diabetes. 2019 update\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, progress has been made to improve the diagnosis and management of hypertension: the population average blood pressure in England has fallen by about 3mmHg systolic and the proportion of adults with untreated high blood pressure has decreased. However, the Public Health England Blood Pressure Action Plan called for further action to reduce the population average blood pressure by 5mmHg through improved prevention, detection and management ([Public Health England's Tackling high blood pressure: from evidence into action]([URL] 2015 and [Tackling high blood pressure: an update]([URL] 2018). Since the publication of the 2011 NICE guideline on hypertension, new studies have been published in key areas of management; in particular, the optimal method and threshold for diagnosis of hypertension, managing blood pressure in lower risk populations and reducing blood pressure to lower targets in people with hypertension (including those with type2 diabetes). The updated guideline makes new recommendations in these areas, based on the evidence, that aim to improve care and reduce variation in current practice."

    "content": "Increased monitoring of routine healthcare data including registries and audits would ensure that the findings from a broader population is captured. These recommendations are likely to result in broader access to isCGM and rtCGM devices, as opposed to a binary decision on access based on stringent criteria. This should reduce inequalities and enable more people to use CGM. Currently, people with more time and knowledge to self-advocate are often more likely to gain access to these devices. Some people have insulin insufficiency because of other conditions. The committee noted that these people would get the same care as people with type1 diabetes, so they should have access to CGM in the same way. There is likely to be an increase in costs from more use of CGM devices. A number of different devices are available, so if more than 1device would be appropriate for a person and would meet their needs and preferences, using the lowest cost device among those options would help to reduce the cost impact.

    "instruction": "Why is ABPM considered the gold standard for measuring blood pressure in primary care?",
    "content": "This is in line with recent evidence that suggests a small difference in arm blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, possibly due to vascular damage. ABPM correlates well with invasive blood pressure measurement and can identify both white-coat and masked hypertension. Based on the evidence in the 2011 guideline and the committee's experience and knowledge, it was agreed that ABPM remains the gold standard for the accurate measurement of blood pressure in primary care. ABPM has therefore been retained as the preferred method for the diagnosis of hypertension. In addition, economic evidence obtained by updating the health economic model for the 2011 guideline confirmed that ABPM is still likely to be the most cost-effective method for diagnosis, even with the inclusion of new data for improved accuracy of home and clinic measurement. The evidence showed that validated HBPM is an accurate method of diagnosing hypertension for people in sinus rhythm. The committee's experience in clinical practice supported this, and the committee agreed that it is a suitable alternative when ABPM is unsuitable or not tolerated. The committee noted that the British and Irish Hypertension Society maintains a list of validated blood pressure devices for home use. The British and Irish Hypertension Society is an independent reviewer of published work and this does not imply any endorsement of specific devices by NICE. The evidence did not suggest that there were any benefits of adding telemonitoring to HBPM. Therefore, the committee agreed that it could not make a recommendation on telemonitoring for the diagnosis of hypertension. The recommendations reinforce current good practice. However, the committee noted that implementation of the 2011 recommendations on ABPM has been challenging and that there is still variation in practice."

They were aware of examples from current practice in which adults who have insulin-treated type2 diabetes and use intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) have had good outcomes. Because of the additional cost associated with CGM and the large number of adults with type2 diabetes, the committee used both the evidence and their clinical experience to decide who would gain the most benefit from using CGM. There was evidence that intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) was cost effective for adults with type2 diabetes using insulin, but no evidence for populations not using insulin, so the committee agreed to restrict their recommendations to that subpopulation. People who have recurrent or severe hypoglycaemic events were identified as one of the groups likely to benefit most from isCGM, because hypoglycaemic events were considered to be one of the most important and concerning outcomes for adults with type2 diabetes who are using insulin. The committee decided that the number of hypoglycaemic events was a more effective indicator of someone who would benefit from isCGM than specific HbA1c target values, because target values can vary between people. The evidence also indicated minimal effects of isCGM on HbA1c values. The committee agreed that people with impaired hypoglycaemic awareness would also benefit from isCGM. However, they did not recommend specific methods for assessing impaired hypoglycaemic awareness. This is because validated methods for assessing impaired hypoglycaemic awareness in people with type2 diabetes (such as the GOLD or Clarke scores) are not always available in primary care."

    "content": "They used a definition for the established cardiovascular disease group (adults with type2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) that reflected the people included in all the clinical trials and modelled as a subgroup in the economic model. To assess whether people are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the committee recommended using the QRISK2 tool because this is recommended in the [NICE guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification]([URL] for adults with type2 diabetes, and the factors covered by this tool were similar to those used in the trials and economic model to define this population. In addition, this tool is widely used in current practice in the NHS. Lifetime cardiovascular risk may be underestimated in people aged under40 using this tool, so the committee also included risk factors to consider for this age group. This definition was broadly aligned to the subgroup of people with high cardiovascular risk without established cardiovascular disease who were included in the model. The evidence showed that SGLT2 inhibitors as a class of drugs were most likely to be cost effective in combination with metformin, although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) varied between different drugs in the class and in different scenarios in the model. The exception to this was dapagliflozin, which was cost effective at a threshold of 20,000 per quality-adjusted life year in the base-case analysis and across a range of model scenarios. However, the committee agreed there was too much uncertainty in the clinical data, and therefore the economic modelling, for them to be confident that these different ICERs represented true underlying differences in cost effectiveness."

The most common misdiagnosis is type1 diabetes being misdiagnosed as type2, which could lead to the person not receiving insulin treatment and a subsequent risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. It is less harmful to be diagnosed with type1 diabetes when the person actually has type2 diabetes.

Because of this lack of new evidence, the committee made a [recommendation for research on identifying diabetes type]([URL]\n\nThe evidence showed that no single clinical feature had a sufficient predictive value to make a diagnosis by itself. The committee were particularly concerned that age and body mass index (BMI) might be used in isolation. They noted that the average BMI in people with type1 diabetes is increasing, and the age at which people are diagnosed with type2 diabetes is decreasing. This means these clinical features are becoming less useful on their own to differentiate between the subtypes. Despite this, the committee agreed that these characteristics are still useful for making an initial working diagnosis of diabetes subtype in many people."

    "instruction": "What are the key characteristics and complications associated with type 2 diabetes as described in the guidelines?",
    "content": "# Context\n\nType2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterised by insulin resistance (that is, the body's inability to effectively use insulin) and insufficient pancreatic insulin production, resulting in high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia). Type2 diabetes is commonly associated with obesity, physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, periodontitis, disturbed blood lipid levels and a tendency to develop thrombosis, and is therefore recognised to have an increased cardiovascular risk. It is associated with longterm microvascular and macrovascular complications, together with reduced quality of life and life expectancy. In 2019, approximately 3. 2million adults in the UK had diagnosed diabetes. About 90% of these people had type2 diabetes. Type2 diabetes is more common in people of African, AfricanCaribbean and South Asian family background. It can occur in all age groups and is increasingly being diagnosed in adolescents and young adults. Multiple vascular risk factors and wideranging complications make diabetes care complex and time-consuming, and many areas of healthcare services must be involved for optimal management. Necessary lifestyle changes, and the complexities and possible side effects of therapy, make structured education and selfmanagement important aspects of diabetes care. Diabetes care is estimated to account for at least 5% of UK healthcare expenditure, and up to 10% of NHS expenditure. This guideline contains recommendations for managing type2 diabetes in adults, and focuses on education, dietary advice, managing cardiovascular risk, managing blood glucose levels, and identifying and managing longterm complications. The guideline does not cover diagnosis, secondary diabetes, type1 diabetes in adults, diabetes in pregnancy or diabetes in children and young people."

    "instruction": "Why is it important to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle for individuals with type 2 diabetes?",
    "content": "The committee agreed that it is important to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle because part of this discussion is to ensure the person is supported with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to improve their current health and prognosis. Reviews should also take into account a person's current clinical circumstances (as detailed in [recommendation1. 7. 1]([URL] on choosing drug treatments). This will help ensure that appropriate treatment options are considered if the person's clinical situation has changed: for example, if it has improved because of weight loss or if they have developed chronic heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. When people with an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease turn 40, their cardiovascular risk may appear to drop when it is assessed using QRISK2. However, this is due to switching from assessing lifetime risk to a 10-year risk calculation rather than an actual decrease in cardiovascular risk. SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should not be stopped for this reason alone. Based on the evidence and the economic model, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors were not confined to first-line treatment for people with elevated cardiovascular risk or chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To ensure that people who are already on drug therapy (including those people who have started first-line treatment, and those people who are further along the treatment pathway and are taking dual or triple therapy) for type2 diabetes can have an SGLT2 inhibitor if their level of cardiovascular risk is sufficiently high or they have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the committee included a separate recommendation on SGLT2 inhibitors for these people. As explained in the rationale for recommendations on first-line treatment, the committee specified SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefits."

However, ABPM was found to be the most cost-effective method of diagnosis, and it is anticipated that the long-term benefits of accurate diagnosis and treatment (such as avoiding over diagnosis and unnecessary treatment) will outweigh any initial costs. [Return to recommendations]([URL]\n\n### Relaxation therapies\n\nThe evidence on relaxation therapies was limited to a single small study. The study suggested some benefit in reducing angina and myocardial infarction, but it also suggested an increase in stroke. The committee agreed that the study was not adequate to assess the effectiveness of these therapies or to make a recommendation. The 2011 guideline stated that relaxation therapies could reduce blood pressure, but it did not recommend their routine use in practice. The committee noted that this was based on evidence for reducing blood pressure only, and there was no evidence of a direct benefit to people with hypertension, such as improving quality of life or reducing cardiovascular events. The committee agreed there was insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that people pursue this option themselves and agreed to remove this recommendation. It is not the intention of the committee to stop people from trying relaxation therapies if they wish to, but to make people aware that there is less evidence for benefit of this intervention compared with other lifestyle interventions or pharmacological treatment. The committee agreed that the clinical focus for non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension should be on encouraging people to make lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight."

    "content": "Because it is still important for these people to monitor their blood glucose levels, the committee made a recommendation to reinforce the importance of offering capillary blood glucose monitoring instead. The committee did not make a recommendation on how long CGM should be used because there was no evidence on this, and they did not want to stop people accessing CGM for short periods if they and their healthcare professional thought they could benefit from this. Using CGM for a short period of time may help some people to understand when they have hypoglycaemic episodes, thereby helping them to develop a more effective treatment plan. Despite the positive recommendations on CGM, the committee were concerned that existing health inequalities may still lead to lower uptake of CGM in some groups of people. To address this, the committee made a recommendation outlining actions for commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals. The committee highlighted the importance of routinely reviewing a person's use of CGM. This will establish whether it is providing clinical benefits and whether the monitor is being used correctly. Making people aware that their use of CGM will be continually reviewed is important so they know it is not a guaranteed long-term option. The committee also made a [recommendation for research on using routinely collected real-world data to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of CGM]([URL] They agreed that this has the potential to show the direct effects of the technology used by people with type2 diabetes instead of interpreting it through the results of clinical trials.

The rest of the recommendation and the other recommendations for GLP1 mimetics were out of scope for this update, so the criteria for accessing a GLP1 mimetic remain unchanged. These recommendations set tight limits on who should be offered a GLP1 mimetic, based on the lack of cost effectiveness of this treatment for most people in the 2015 guideline. Since no new drug options have been added to later stages of treatment, these recommendations are not expected to lead to an increase in resource impact over that detailed above for starting drug treatment with metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor, or an SGLT2 inhibitor alone, or for people who are already on drug therapy when an SGLT2 inhibitor is or becomes appropriate based on their cardiovascular risk.

[Return to recommendations]([URL]\n\n### Continuous glucose monitoring\n\n[Recommendations 1. 6. 10 to 1. 6. 18]([URL]\n\nThe committee agreed that there was enough evidence in key outcomes, such as HbA1c, time in range and severe or nocturnal hypoglycaemia, to demonstrate that both real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) and intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) provide clinical benefits over standard self-monitoring of blood glucose. However, they considered that the evidence for rtCGM compared with isCGM was not good enough in terms of quality or sample size to clearly show clinical benefits of 1technology over the other. The committee also acknowledged that CGM technologies were changing very quickly, with increasing overlap between rtCGM and isCGM as features such as predictive alerts are added to newer isCGM devices. The health economic modelling found that, when the benefit of reduced fear of hypoglycaemia with CGM was included, both technologies were cost effective for the full population of adults with type1 diabetes compared with standard self-monitoring of blood glucose. Based on the above factors and the evidence, the committee agreed that there was no advantage to recommending 1specific device over another compared with standard self-monitoring of blood glucose. They concluded that the specific functionality of isCGM versus rtCGM devices should be discussed between the person and their healthcare professional."

Most people in these trials were expected to be able to take metformin. The committee agreed with the assumption that people who cannot tolerate metformin or for whom it is contraindicated would be offered the next most effective and cost-effective treatment options after metformin. In the economic model scenario, when another drug was used in place of metformin for people with established cardiovascular disease or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, SGLT2 inhibitors were the class of drugs that were most likely to be cost effective. The committee therefore prioritised this class of drugs for these people. As before, there was greater certainty in the results for people with established cardiovascular disease compared with those at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and the rationale for referring to SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit also applies here. Some people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin. There was no evidence specifically for this group so the committee made the same assumption as above (that these people would take the next most effective and cost-effective treatment).

    "instruction": "What did the committee conclude regarding the use of spironolactone and the recommendation for high-dose thiazide diuretics as step 4 treatment?",
    "content": "Despite the lack of evidence formally reviewed, the committee discussed the recommendation based on their clinical experience, taking the 2011 recommendations into account. The committee agreed that although the evidence for spironolactone did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the updated review for the guideline because the key study had a very short follow up and did not report any of the cardiovascular outcomes specified in this review protocol, the use of an aldosterone antagonist is now common clinical practice. Therefore, there was no reason to suggest that this recommendation should be changed. In the 2011 guideline, high-dose thiazide diuretics were recommended as a potential step4 treatment in people with high blood potassium levels. The committee felt that there was a lack of evidence for this approach and noted that the studies did not show an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes at higher doses, albeit in people without resistant hypertension. The committee agreed that the recommendation for considering alpha- or beta-blockers should be retained based on significant clinical experience of their safe and effective use and because adding a further drug is likely to have a greater effect on blood pressure than increasing the thiazide diuretic dose. The recommendations represent current good practice and so should not change practice. High-dose thiazide diuretics are not commonly used as step4 therapy and so removing this should not change practice. There might be a small reduction in step4 treatment with more thorough checks to confirm resistant hypertension. However, this may also result in an increase in blood pressure measurements to appropriately confirm resistant hypertension where this is not already being done.

    "instruction": "What is the significance of implementing evidence-based guidelines in the context of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy?",
    "content": "# Context\n\nHypertensive disorders during pregnancy affect around 8% to 10% of all pregnant women and can be associated with substantial complications for the woman and the baby. Women can have hypertension before pregnancy or it can be diagnosed in the first 20weeks (known as chronic hypertension), new onset of hypertension occurring in the second half of pregnancy (gestational hypertension) or new hypertension with features of multi-organ involvement (pre-eclampsia). Although the proportion of women with pregnancy hypertensive disorders overall appears to have stayed reasonably stable, maternal mortality from hypertensive causes has fallen dramatically: less than 1woman in every million who gives birth now dies from pre-eclampsia. There is consensus that introduction of the 2010 NICE evidence-based guidelines, together with the findings from the confidential enquiry into maternal deaths, has made a pivotal contribution to this fall in maternal mortality. However, hypertension in pregnancy continues to cause substantial maternal morbidity, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, and perinatal morbidity. Women with hypertension in pregnancy are also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Variations in care contribute to inequity in adverse outcomes. Adoption and implementation of evidence-based national guidelines have a central role in reducing this variance and improving care and outcomes across the maternity service. Research that has been done since publication of the previous guideline has addressed areas of uncertainty and highlighted where the recommendations can be updated."

    "content": "The committee agreed there was more certainty of cardiovascular benefits in adults with type2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because they were participants in all the included trials, while people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease were included in fewer trials. So, they recommended dual therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to metformin for both groups, but only as an option to consider for people without established cardiovascular disease, to reflect the lower certainty. For people without a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease who do not have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, metformin monotherapy remains the recommended first-line treatment option, based on the 2015 recommendation. When starting first-line dual therapy, the committee noted the importance of introducing the drugs sequentially. This enables any side effects and intolerances from the first drug to be identified before the second drug is introduced. In line with current practice, the committee recommended starting with metformin and then adding the SGLT2 inhibitor without delay once metformin tolerability is established, to avoid people remaining on metformin alone for prolonged periods. Some people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor. As GLP1 mimetics were not cost-effective options in this situation (see the rationale and impact section on why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment), the committee agreed that these people would be offered metformin alone as a first-line treatment (see [recommendation1. 7."

    "content": "12]([URL]\n\nThe committee agreed that pregnant woman with chronic hypertension should be offered lifestyle advice similar to other adults with hypertension, and in line with the [NICE guideline on hypertension in adults]([URL]\n\nThere was very little evidence available on treatment initiation thresholds for chronic hypertension in pregnancy, so the committee based their recommendations on the values specified in the recent Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) and the NICE guideline on hypertension in adults. There was evidence for target blood pressure levels from the large CHIPS trial, so the committee made recommendations based on this. There was some very limited evidence of both benefits and harms for different antihypertensive medicines. However, there was not enough evidence to recommend one treatment over another. As labetalol, nifedipine and methyldopa had been recommended in the previous guideline (for gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia), and these medicines had been used for many years in pregnancy, the committee agreed they should be preferred treatment options for chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Labetalol is specifically licensed for use in pregnancy and so is suggested as the first-line option, with nifedipine as the next alternative, and methyldopa as the third option (as it may lead to more side effects and be the least effective option of the3). There was some very limited evidence for the benefits of aspirin in reducing preterm births and neonatal unit admissions, so the committee retained the recommendation on aspirin from the previous guideline, but incorporated it into the section on the treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy. The committee noted that the studies used different doses of aspirin (ranging from 50mg to 150mg daily), and that common practice in the UK was to offer 75mg to 150mg, therefore this dose range was recommended."

    "instruction": "What recommendation did the committee make regarding the discussion of periodontitis in patients with diabetes?",
    "content": "4]([URL]\n\nThe evidence showed that people with diabetes are at increased risk of periodontitis, and that non-surgical periodontal treatment can improve diabetes control. However, in the committee's experience, people with diabetes are often unaware of this and may not be having regular oral health reviews. To address this, the committee recommended routinely discussing the risk of periodontitis at annual reviews, alongside eye disease and foot problems. The evidence also showed that periodontal treatment is cost effective for people with type 2 diabetes, assuming improvements in HbA1c are maintained. This was tested with health economic modelling in a range of different scenarios. There were some scenarios where periodontal treatment was not cost effective, but the committee did not think these scenarios reflected real-world practice. For oral healthcare professionals, the long-term impact of the recommendations is uncertain. The recommendations specify that people should follow existing NICE guidelines on oral health. However, the recommendations may also increase awareness of periodontitis, leading to a possible short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews. Any increase in the number of oral health reviews will potentially impact on services, as NHS dental services already have capacity issues. A short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews will also lead to a short-term increase in costs. However, there is likely to be a larger long-term reduction in costs from the improvement to oral health and diabetes control. Oral healthcare and dental teams will need clear advice on what they need to do for people with diabetes. They will need clear care pathways to improve quality of care and service delivery, in line with the [NHS England commissioning standard on dental care for people with diabetes]([URL]\n\nMany people do not have regular oral health reviews, even if they are eligible for free NHS dental care."
